# Predicting Age with Methylation Markers using ElasticNet

Aging is a hot subject in biomedicine and the greater community. For example, perhaps you have tried to use
Microsoft’s age predictor “How old do I look” (https://how-old.net/), an attempt to predict your age based on an image of you.

Prediction of age can be important to understand the difference between chronological and biological age. Steve Horvath, a professor of bioinformatics at UCLA, built an age predictor using DNA methylation marks as predictors to examine potential differences in chronological and biological aging. In this paper, Prof. Horvath assembled a large set of publicly available DNA methylation (Illumina 450K and other array assays) data and asked a simple question: can DNA methylation levels predict chronological age? And if so, are deviations from predicted age evidence for accelerated aging?
